### User Survey

I originally had the idea to create a dream tour of AR, but after speaking with several people, I got to know that most people have trouble with their online shopping, especially when they are buying used products. As a result, they end up being loss with their purchases.

### Problem Statement
Here, my audience bought a used product from an internet store that in offers deals, but they don't know the conditions correctly.

He was disappointed when the item was delivered to him.

-----

### Prossible solution
Therefore, we can now scan products in 3D so that customers may view the condition accurately in AR view.

-----

### Executive Intent
This project is all about making used items to sell. Users can buy of their choice. In addition to that, they can also get AR view and information at the same time. Moreover, they can freely.

### Qualitative Analysis

I interviewed them using Zoom to do video and phone interviews. I had the opportunity to speak with 9 people and learn about their problems and motivations.

Here are some general questions I asked during the interactions:
Q1. Which phone do you use most? 
Q2. Where do you go if you want to buy used item? 
Q3. What if you had the opportunity to sell your used item? 
Q4. Which method do you favor to sell online or offline? 
Q5. Which digital processes do you prefer? 
Q6. How would you sum up the features you seek in an app? 
Q7. Do you want to scan your used item for augmented reality?
Q8. What aspects would encourage you to return again and again? 
Q9. Can you give examples of either good or bad app experiences you've had? 
Q10. Can you tell me how this app could help you more?

### Quantitative analysist
