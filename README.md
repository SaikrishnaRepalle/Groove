## 📊 User Survey
I originally had the idea to create a dream tour of AR, but after speaking with several people, I got to know that most people have trouble with their online shopping, especially when they are buying used products. As a result, they end up being loss with their purchases.

###   

## 📝 Problem Statement
Here, my audience bought a used product from an internet store that in offers deals, but they don't know the conditions correctly.<br > He was disappointed when the item was delivered to him.

### 📈 Qualitative Analysis

>I interviewed them using Zoom to do video and phone interviews. I had the opportunity to speak with 9 people and learn about their problems and  motivations.

Here are some general questions I asked during the interactions:

1. Which phone do you use most?
2. Where do you go if you want to buy used item?
3. What if you had the opportunity to sell your used item?
4. Which method do you favor to sell online or offline?
5. Which digital processes do you prefer?
6. How would you sum up the features you seek in an app?
7. Do you want to scan your used item for augmented reality?
8. What aspects would encourage you to return again and again?
9. Can you give examples of either good or bad app experiences you've had?
10. Can you tell me how this app could help you more?

### Quantitative analysist

I conducted an online poll using Type Forms to see if there was any resemblance in what potential consumers wanted. The poll received 33+ responses, which helped us outline the problem accurately.

The Type Form I created for the user research is provided below.


### ⭐️ Insights


- I tried to order a used item, but the photos were brand new.

- I must compare prices in AR side by side.

- When ordering used goods, I'm very concerned about the condition.

- Being concerned about stolen used goods

- Worry about having all my details stolen.

- I ordered one item and received a different one in a different color.
