### User Survey

I originally had the idea to create a dream tour of AR, but after speaking with several people, I got to know that most people have trouble with their online shopping, especially when they are buying used products. As a result, they end up being loss with their purchases.

### Problem Statement
Here, my audience bought a used product from an internet store that in offers deals, but they don't know the conditions correctly.

He was disappointed when the item was delivered to him.


Therefore, we can now scan products in 3D so that customers may view the condition accurately in AR view.


### Prototype
