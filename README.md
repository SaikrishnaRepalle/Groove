## About

Object scaning is a tool that allows you to capture blendshape animations directly from a compatible iOS device to the Unity Editor. if you want a Unity project with all dependencies built in.

### User Survey

I originally had the idea to create a dream tour of AR, but after speaking with several people, I got to know that most people have trouble with their online shopping, especially when they are buying used products. As a result, they end up being loss with their purchases.

### Problem Statement
Here, my audience bought a used product from an internet store that in offers deals, but they don't know the conditions correctly.

He was disappointed when the item was delivered to him.

### Problem Statement

Therefore, we can now scan products in 3D so that customers may view the condition accurately in AR view.
